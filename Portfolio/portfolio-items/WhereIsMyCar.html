            <p>She never liked cleaning the sink. It was beyond her comprehension how it got so dirty so quickly.
                It seemed that she was forced to clean it every other day. Even when she was extra careful to keep
                things clean and orderly, it still ended up looking like a mess in a couple of days. What she didn't
                know was there was a tiny creature living in it that didn't like things neat.

                Colors bounced around in her head. They mixed and threaded themselves together. Even colors that had 
                no business being together. They were all one, yet distinctly separate at the same time. How was she 
                going to explain this to the others?
            </p>
            <p>There were little things that she simply could not stand. The sound of someone tapping their nails on 
                the table. A person chewing with their mouth open. Another human imposing themselves into her space. 
                She couldn't stand any of these things, but none of them compared to the number one thing she couldn't 
                stand which topped all of them combined.</p>
