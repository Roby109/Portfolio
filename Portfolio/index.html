                    <h3>University</h3>
                    <p>Currently I am attending Sheffield Hallam University, as a computer science student in my 3rd and final year. 
                        Throughout my time in education, I have found myself challenged and overcome a multitude of problems concerning 
                        my assignments, all whilst enjoying the content of the course, making sure that my final version is worthy of the 
                        highest grades available.</p>

                <div class="service">
                    <h3>Self-Learning Projects</h3>
                    <p>Whilst I have had free time from my studies at University, I have found myself learning new skills and with those 
                        skills have started to make projects. Most of these projects mentioned are linked with learning a new programme or 
                        a new language, and due to this I have found myself spending hours learning about new things and creating some projects 
                        that I am proud of.</p>

            <div class="about-me__body">
                <p>Throughout my education and employment, I have demonstrated high levels of motivation, work ethics, this has
                    been demonstrated by my continued dedication and excellent attendance and my ability to finish tasks to competition,
                    I have also achieved the highest grades in my BTEC extended diploma. I pride myself on arriving early to my university 
                    classes, and I consider myself to be reliable, punctual, and hardworking, this can be seen throughout all my assignments.</p>
                <p>I enjoy my time at home on my computer as I am an avid gamer, I particularly enjoyed being part of the eSports society, 
                    playing tactical games. With others from my University course, I also dabbled in Unity over the start of the summer. 
                    Coding is a passion I pursue and enjoy seeing the programmes that I have worked on operating with minimal bugs, by having 
                    patience while removing any issues.</p>
                <p>I also enjoy socialising with my friends, this would include visits to the cinema and other activities. Photography is a
                     hobby when I have the free time, I take pleasure in the landscape views and have moved into more creative photography.</p>
